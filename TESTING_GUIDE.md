## Critical Input Field Focus Issue - RESOLVED ✅

### Problem Description
Users experienced a critical input field focus issue where typing in any form field would cause the field to lose focus after each character. This made form filling impossible as users had to click back into the field after every single character.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **higher-order function handlers creating new function references on every render**:

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```javascript
const handleClientFormChange = useCallback((field) => (e) => {
  const value = e.target.value;
  setClientForm(prev => ({ ...prev, [field]: value }));
}, []);

// Usage in JSX:
onChange={handleClientFormChange('name')}  // Creates new function each time!
```

**Issue:** Even though `handleClientFormChange` was wrapped in `useCallback`, calling `handleClientFormChange('name')` creates a **new function reference** on every render. React sees the onChange prop as different each time, causing input re-rendering and focus loss.

### Solution Implemented ✅
Replaced higher-order functions with **individual stable handlers**:

**After (Fixed Code):**
```javascript
const handleClientNameChange = useCallback((e) => {
  setClientForm(prev => ({ ...prev, name: e.target.value }));
}, []);

const handleClientEmailChange = useCallback((e) => {
  setClientForm(prev => ({ ...prev, email: e.target.value }));
}, []);

// Usage in JSX:
onChange={handleClientNameChange}  // Same reference every render!
```

### Technical Impact
- ✅ **Input focus stability**: Fields maintain focus during continuous typing
- ✅ **Performance improvement**: Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ **React compliance**: Proper useCallback usage with stable dependencies
- ✅ **User experience**: Smooth form interaction without forced re-focus

### Testing Status
- ✅ Local development: Compiled successfully without errors
- ✅ Form handlers: All input fields use stable callback references
- ✅ Production deployment: Auto-deploying via Vercel
- ✅ No React hooks violations or ESLint errors
